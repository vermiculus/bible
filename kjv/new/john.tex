\Chapter
\Verse In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

\Verse The same was in the beginning with God.

\Verse All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.

\Verse In him was life; and the life was the light of men.

\Verse And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

\Verse There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

\Verse The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.

\Verse He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.

\Verse That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

\Verse He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

\Verse He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

\Verse But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: \Verse Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

\Verse And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

\Verse John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.

\Verse And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.

\Verse For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

\Verse No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.

\Verse And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?  \Verse And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.

\Verse And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.

\Verse Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?  \Verse He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.

\Verse And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.

\Verse And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?  \Verse John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not; \Verse He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

\Verse These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.

\Verse The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.

\Verse This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.

\Verse And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.

\Verse And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.

\Verse And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.

\Verse And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.

\Verse Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; \Verse And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!  \Verse And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.

\Verse Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?  \Verse He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.

\Verse One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.

\Verse He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.

\Verse And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.

\Verse The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.

\Verse Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

\Verse Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.

\Verse And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.

\Verse Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!  \Verse Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.

\Verse Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.

\Verse Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.

\Verse And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.


\Chapter
\Verse And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: \Verse And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.

\Verse And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.

\Verse Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.

\Verse His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.

\Verse And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.

\Verse Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.

\Verse And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.

\Verse When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, \Verse And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.

\Verse This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.

\Verse After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.

\Verse And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

\Verse And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: \Verse And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; \Verse And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.

\Verse And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.

\Verse Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?  \Verse Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.

\Verse Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?  \Verse But he spake of the temple of his body.

\Verse When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.

\Verse Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.

\Verse But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, \Verse And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.


\Chapter
\Verse There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: \Verse The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.

\Verse Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

\Verse Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?  can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?  \Verse Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

\Verse That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

\Verse Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.

\Verse The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

\Verse Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?  \Verse Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?  \Verse Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.

\Verse If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?  \Verse And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.

\Verse And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: \Verse That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.

\Verse For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

\Verse For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

\Verse He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

\Verse And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.

\Verse For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.

\Verse But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.

\Verse After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.

\Verse And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.

\Verse For John was not yet cast into prison.

\Verse Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.

\Verse And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.

\Verse John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.

\Verse Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.

\Verse He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.

\Verse He must increase, but I must decrease.

\Verse He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.

\Verse And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.

\Verse He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.

\Verse For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.

\Verse The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.

\Verse He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.


\Chapter
\Verse When therefore the \LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, \Verse (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) \Verse He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.

\Verse And he must needs go through Samaria.

\Verse Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

\Verse Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.

\Verse There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.

\Verse (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)  \Verse Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.

\Verse Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.

\Verse The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?  \Verse Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?  \Verse Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: \Verse But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.

\Verse The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.

\Verse Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.

\Verse The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: \Verse For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.

\Verse The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.

\Verse Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.

\Verse Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.

\Verse Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.

\Verse But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.

\Verse God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.

\Verse The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.

\Verse Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.

\Verse And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?  \Verse The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, \Verse Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?  \Verse Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.

\Verse In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.

\Verse But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.

\Verse Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?  \Verse Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.

\Verse Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?  behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.

\Verse And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.

\Verse And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.

\Verse I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.

\Verse And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.

\Verse So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.

\Verse And many more believed because of his own word; \Verse And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.

\Verse Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.

\Verse For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.

\Verse Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.

\Verse So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.

\Verse When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.

\Verse Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.

\Verse The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.

\Verse Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.

\Verse And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.

\Verse Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.

\Verse So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.

\Verse This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.


\Chapter
\Verse After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

\Verse Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.

\Verse In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.

\Verse For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

\Verse And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.

\Verse When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?  \Verse The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.

\Verse Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.

\Verse And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.

\Verse The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.

\Verse He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.

\Verse Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?  \Verse And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.

\Verse Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.

\Verse The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.

\Verse And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.

\Verse But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.

\Verse Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.

\Verse Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.

\Verse For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.

\Verse For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.

\Verse For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: \Verse That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.

He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.

\Verse Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.

\Verse Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.

\Verse For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; \Verse And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.

\Verse Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, \Verse And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.

\Verse I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.

\Verse If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.

\Verse There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.

\Verse Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.

\Verse But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.

\Verse He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.

\Verse But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.

\Verse And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me.

Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.

\Verse And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.

\Verse Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.

\Verse And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.

\Verse I receive not honour from men.

\Verse But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.

\Verse I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.

\Verse How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?  \Verse Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.

\Verse For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.

\Verse But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?  
\Chapter
\Verse After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.

\Verse And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.

\Verse And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.

\Verse And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.

\Verse When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?  \Verse And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.

\Verse Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.

\Verse One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him, \Verse There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?  \Verse And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.

\Verse And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.

\Verse When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.

\Verse Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.

\Verse Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.

\Verse When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.

\Verse And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea, \Verse And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.  And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.

\Verse And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.

\Verse So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.

\Verse But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.

\Verse Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.

\Verse The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone; \Verse (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:) \Verse When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.

\Verse And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?  \Verse Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.

\Verse Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.

\Verse Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?  \Verse Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.

\Verse They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?  \Verse Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.

\Verse Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.

\Verse For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.

\Verse Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.

\Verse And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.

\Verse But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.

\Verse All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.

\Verse For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.

\Verse And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.

\Verse And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.

\Verse The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.

\Verse And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?  \Verse Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.

\Verse No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.

\Verse It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.

Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.

\Verse Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.

\Verse Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.

\Verse I am that bread of life.

\Verse Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.

\Verse This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.

\Verse I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.

\Verse The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?  \Verse Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.

\Verse Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.

\Verse For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.

\Verse He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.

\Verse As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.

\Verse This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.

\Verse These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.

\Verse Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?  \Verse When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?  \Verse What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?  \Verse It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.

\Verse But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.

\Verse And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.

\Verse From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.

\Verse Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?  \Verse Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.

\Verse And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.

\Verse Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?  \Verse He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.


\Chapter
\Verse After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.

\Verse Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.

\Verse His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.

\Verse For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.

\Verse For neither did his brethren believe in him.

\Verse Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.

\Verse The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.

\Verse Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.

\Verse When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.

\Verse But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.

\Verse Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?  \Verse And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.

\Verse Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.

\Verse Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.

\Verse And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?  \Verse Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.

\Verse If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.

\Verse He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.

\Verse Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?  Why go ye about to kill me?  \Verse The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?  \Verse Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.

\Verse Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.

\Verse If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?  \Verse Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.

\Verse Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?  \Verse But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?  \Verse Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.

\Verse Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.

\Verse But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.

\Verse Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.

\Verse And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?  \Verse The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.

\Verse Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.

\Verse Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.

\Verse Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?  \Verse What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?  \Verse In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.

\Verse He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.

\Verse (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)  \Verse Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.

\Verse Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?  \Verse Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?  \Verse So there was a division among the people because of him.

\Verse And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.

\Verse Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?  \Verse The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.

\Verse Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?  \Verse Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?  \Verse But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.

\Verse Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) \Verse Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?  \Verse They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee?  Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.

\Verse And every man went unto his own house.


\Chapter
\Verse Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.

\Verse And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.

\Verse And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, \Verse They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.

\Verse Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?  \Verse This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.

\Verse So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.

\Verse And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.

\Verse And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.

\Verse When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?  \Verse She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.

\Verse Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.

\Verse The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.

\Verse Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.

\Verse Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.

\Verse And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.

\Verse It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.

\Verse I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.

\Verse Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.

\Verse These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.

\Verse Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.

\Verse Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.

\Verse And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.

\Verse I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.

\Verse Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.

\Verse I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.

\Verse They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.

\Verse Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.

\Verse And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.

\Verse As he spake these words, many believed on him.

\Verse Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; \Verse And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

\Verse They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?  \Verse Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.

\Verse And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.

\Verse If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.

\Verse I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.

\Verse I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.

\Verse They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.

\Verse But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.

\Verse Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.

\Verse Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.

\Verse Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.

\Verse Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.

\Verse And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.

\Verse Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?  \Verse He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.

\Verse Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?  \Verse Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.

\Verse And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.

\Verse Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.

\Verse Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.

Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.

\Verse Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?  \Verse Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: \Verse Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.

\Verse Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.

\Verse Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?  \Verse Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.

\Verse Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.


\Chapter
\Verse And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.

\Verse And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?  \Verse Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.

\Verse I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.

\Verse As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.

\Verse When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, \Verse And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.

\Verse The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?  \Verse Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.

\Verse Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?  \Verse He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.

\Verse Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.

\Verse They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.

\Verse And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.

\Verse Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.

\Verse Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.

\Verse They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.

\Verse But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.

\Verse And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?  \Verse His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: \Verse But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.

\Verse These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.

\Verse Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.

\Verse Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.

\Verse He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.

\Verse Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?  \Verse He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?  \Verse Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.

\Verse We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.

\Verse The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.

\Verse Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.

\Verse Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.

\Verse If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.

\Verse They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

\Verse Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?  \Verse He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?  \Verse And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.

\Verse And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.

\Verse And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.

\Verse And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?  \Verse Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.


\Chapter
\Verse Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.

\Verse But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

\Verse To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.

\Verse And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.

\Verse And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.

\Verse This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.

\Verse Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.

\Verse All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.

\Verse I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.

\Verse The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.

\Verse I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.

\Verse But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.

\Verse The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.

\Verse I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.

\Verse As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.

\Verse And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.

\Verse Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.

\Verse No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

\Verse There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.

\Verse And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?  \Verse Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?  \Verse And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.

\Verse And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.

\Verse Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.

\Verse Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.

\Verse But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.

\Verse My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: \Verse And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.

\Verse My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

\Verse I and my Father are one.

\Verse Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.

\Verse Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?  \Verse The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.

\Verse Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?  \Verse If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; \Verse Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?  \Verse If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.

\Verse But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.

\Verse Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, \Verse And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.

\Verse And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.

\Verse And many believed on him there.


\Chapter
\Verse Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.

\Verse (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)  \Verse Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.

\Verse When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.

\Verse Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.

\Verse When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.

\Verse Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.

\Verse His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?  \Verse Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.

\Verse But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.

\Verse These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.

\Verse Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.

\Verse Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.

\Verse Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.

\Verse And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.

\Verse Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.

\Verse Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.

\Verse Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: \Verse And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.

\Verse Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.

\Verse Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

\Verse But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.

\Verse Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.

\Verse Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.

\Verse Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: \Verse And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?  \Verse She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.

\Verse And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.

\Verse As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.

\Verse Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.

\Verse The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.

\Verse Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.

\Verse When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.

\Verse And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.

\Verse Jesus wept.

\Verse Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!  \Verse And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?  \Verse Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.

\Verse Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.

\Verse Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?  \Verse Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.

\Verse And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.

\Verse And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.

\Verse And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.

\Verse Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.

\Verse But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.

\Verse Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.

\Verse If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.

\Verse And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, \Verse Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.

\Verse And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; \Verse And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.

\Verse Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.

\Verse Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.

\Verse And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.

\Verse Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?  \Verse Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.


\Chapter
\Verse Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.

\Verse There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.

\Verse Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.

\Verse Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, \Verse Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?  \Verse This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.

\Verse Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.

\Verse For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.

\Verse Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.

\Verse But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death; \Verse Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.

\Verse On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, \Verse Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.

\Verse And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, \Verse Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.

\Verse These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.

\Verse The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.

\Verse For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.

\Verse The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.

\Verse And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: \Verse The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.

\Verse Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.

\Verse And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.

\Verse Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.

\Verse He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.

\Verse If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.

\Verse Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.

\Verse Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

\Verse The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.

\Verse Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.

\Verse Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.

\Verse And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.

\Verse This he said, signifying what death he should die.

\Verse The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?  \Verse Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you.

Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.

\Verse While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.

\Verse But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: \Verse That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?  \Verse Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, \Verse He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.

\Verse These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.

\Verse Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: \Verse For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.

\Verse Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.

\Verse And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.

\Verse I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.

\Verse And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.

\Verse He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.

\Verse For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.

\Verse And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.


\Chapter
\Verse Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.

\Verse And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; \Verse Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; \Verse He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.

\Verse After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.

\Verse Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?  \Verse Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter.

\Verse Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.

\Verse Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.

\Verse Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all.

\Verse For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.

\Verse So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?  \Verse Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.

\Verse If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.

\Verse For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.

\Verse Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.

\Verse If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.

\Verse I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.

\Verse Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he.

\Verse Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.

\Verse When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.

\Verse Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake.

\Verse Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.

\Verse Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.

\Verse He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?  \Verse Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.

\Verse And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto him, That thou doest, do quickly.

\Verse Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him.

\Verse For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.

\Verse He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.

\Verse Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.

\Verse If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.

\Verse Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come; so now I say to you.

\Verse A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.

\Verse By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.

\Verse Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.

\Verse Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thy sake.

\Verse Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till thou hast denied me thrice.


\Chapter
\Verse Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.

\Verse In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.

\Verse And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.

\Verse And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.

\Verse Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?  \Verse Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

\Verse If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.

\Verse Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.

\Verse Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?  \Verse Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?  the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.

\Verse Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.

\Verse Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.

\Verse And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

\Verse If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.

\Verse If ye love me, keep my commandments.

\Verse And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; \Verse Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.

\Verse I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.

\Verse Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.

\Verse At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.

\Verse He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.

\Verse Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?  \Verse Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.

\Verse He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.

\Verse These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.

\Verse But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.

\Verse Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

\Verse Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.

\Verse And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.

\Verse Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.

\Verse But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.


\Chapter
\Verse I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.

\Verse Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

\Verse Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.

\Verse Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.

\Verse I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.

\Verse If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.

\Verse If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.

\Verse Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.

\Verse As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.

\Verse If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

\Verse These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.

\Verse This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.

\Verse Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.

\Verse Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.

\Verse Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.

\Verse Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.

\Verse These things I command you, that ye love one another.

\Verse If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.

\Verse If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.

\Verse Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.

\Verse But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.

\Verse If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.

\Verse He that hateth me hateth my Father also.

\Verse If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.

\Verse But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.

\Verse But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me: \Verse And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.


\Chapter
\Verse These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.

\Verse They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.

\Verse And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.

\Verse But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.

\Verse But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?  \Verse But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.

\Verse Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.

\Verse And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: \Verse Of sin, because they believe not on me; \Verse Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; \Verse Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.

\Verse I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.

\Verse Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.

\Verse He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

\Verse All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.

\Verse A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.

\Verse Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?  \Verse They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.

\Verse Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?  \Verse Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.

\Verse A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.

\Verse And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.

\Verse And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.

\Verse Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.

\Verse These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.

\Verse At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: \Verse For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.

\Verse I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.

\Verse His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.

\Verse Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.

\Verse Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?  \Verse Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.

\Verse These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.

In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.


\Chapter
\Verse These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: \Verse As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.

\Verse And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.

\Verse I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.

\Verse And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.

\Verse I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.

\Verse Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.

\Verse For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.

\Verse I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.

\Verse And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.

\Verse And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.

\Verse While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.

\Verse And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.

\Verse I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

\Verse I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.

\Verse They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.

\Verse Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.

\Verse As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.

\Verse And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.

\Verse Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; \Verse That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

\Verse And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: \Verse I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.

\Verse Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.

\Verse O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.

\Verse And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.


\Chapter
\Verse When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.

\Verse And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.

\Verse Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.

\Verse Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?  \Verse They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he.

And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.

\Verse As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.

\Verse Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.

\Verse Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: \Verse That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.

\Verse Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.

\Verse Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?  \Verse Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him, \Verse And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.

\Verse Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.

\Verse And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.

\Verse But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.

\Verse Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.

\Verse And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.

\Verse The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.

\Verse Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.

\Verse Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.

\Verse And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?  \Verse Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?  \Verse Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.

\Verse And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.

\Verse One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?  \Verse Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.

\Verse Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.

\Verse Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?  \Verse They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.

\Verse Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: \Verse That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.

\Verse Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?  \Verse Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?  \Verse Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?  \Verse Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.

\Verse Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.

\Verse Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.

\Verse But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?  \Verse Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.


\Chapter
\Verse Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.

\Verse And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, \Verse And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.

\Verse Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.

\Verse Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!  \Verse When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.

\Verse The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.

\Verse When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; \Verse And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.

\Verse Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?  \Verse Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.

\Verse And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.

\Verse When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.

\Verse And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!  \Verse But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.

Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.

\Verse Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.

\Verse And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha: \Verse Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.

\Verse And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.

\Verse This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.

\Verse Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.

\Verse Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

\Verse Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.

\Verse They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.

\Verse Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.

\Verse When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!  \Verse Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.

\Verse After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.

\Verse Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.

\Verse When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.

\Verse The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.

\Verse Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.

\Verse But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: \Verse But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.

\Verse And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.

\Verse For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.

\Verse And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.

\Verse And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.

\Verse And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.

\Verse Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.

\Verse Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.

\Verse There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.


\Chapter
\Verse The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre.

\Verse Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the \LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.

\Verse Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.

\Verse So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.

\Verse And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.

\Verse Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie, \Verse And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.

\Verse Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.

\Verse For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.

\Verse Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.

\Verse But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, \Verse And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.

\Verse And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my \LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.

\Verse And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.

\Verse Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou?  She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.

\Verse Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.

\Verse Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.

\Verse Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the \LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.

\Verse Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.

\Verse And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side.

Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the \LORD.

\Verse Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.

\Verse And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: \Verse Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.

\Verse But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

\Verse The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the \LORD.

But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.

\Verse And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.

\Verse Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.

\Verse And Thomas answered and said unto him, My \LORD and my God.

\Verse Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.

\Verse And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: \Verse But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.


\Chapter
\Verse After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.

\Verse There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.

\Verse Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.

\Verse But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.

\Verse Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.

\Verse And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.

\Verse Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.

\Verse And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.

\Verse As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.

\Verse Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.

\Verse Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.

\Verse Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.

\Verse Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.

\Verse This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.

\Verse So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.

\Verse He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

\Verse He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.

\Verse Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.

\Verse This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.  And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.

\Verse Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?  \Verse Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?  \Verse Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.

\Verse Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?  \Verse This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.

\Verse And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
