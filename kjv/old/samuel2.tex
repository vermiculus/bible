\Chapter
\Verse Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; \Verse It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

\Verse And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

\Verse And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.

And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

\Verse And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  \Verse And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

\Verse And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.

\Verse And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.

\Verse He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.

\Verse So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.

\Verse Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: \Verse And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the \LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.

\Verse And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou?  And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.

\Verse And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the \LORD's anointed?  \Verse And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.

\Verse And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the \LORD's anointed.

\Verse And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: \Verse (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)  \Verse The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!  \Verse Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

\Verse Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.

\Verse From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.

\Verse Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.

\Verse Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.

\Verse How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.

\Verse I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.

\Verse How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!  
\Chapter
\Verse And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the \LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the \LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.

\Verse So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

\Verse And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

\Verse And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.

\Verse And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the \LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried him.

\Verse And now the \LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing.

\Verse Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.

\Verse But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; \Verse And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.

\Verse Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.

\Verse And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.

\Verse And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

\Verse And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.

\Verse And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

\Verse Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.

\Verse And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon.

\Verse And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.

\Verse And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

\Verse And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

\Verse Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am.

\Verse And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour.

But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him.

\Verse And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?  \Verse Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

\Verse Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

\Verse And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.

\Verse Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever?  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?  how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?  \Verse And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.

\Verse So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.

\Verse And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.

\Verse And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.

\Verse But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.

\Verse And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.


\Chapter
\Verse Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.

\Verse And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; \Verse And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; \Verse And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; \Verse And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.

\Verse And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.

\Verse And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?  \Verse Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman?  \Verse So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the \LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him; \Verse To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.

\Verse And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.

\Verse And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.

\Verse And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.

\Verse And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.

\Verse And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.

\Verse And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim.

Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.

\Verse And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you: \Verse Now then do it: for the \LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.

\Verse And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.

\Verse So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.

\Verse And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth.  And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.

\Verse And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.

\Verse When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.

\Verse Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?  behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone?  \Verse Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest.

\Verse And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.

\Verse And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.

\Verse And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the \LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner: \Verse Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.

\Verse So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

\Verse And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.

\Verse And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.

\Verse And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth?  \Verse Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him.

\Verse And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

\Verse And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

\Verse For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

\Verse And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?  \Verse And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the \LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.


\Chapter
\Verse And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

\Verse And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.

\Verse And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)  \Verse And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.

\Verse And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.

\Verse And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

\Verse For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.

\Verse And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the \LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.

\Verse And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the \LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, \Verse When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings: \Verse How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?  \Verse And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.


\Chapter
\Verse Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

\Verse Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the \LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel.

\Verse So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the \LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.

\Verse David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.

\Verse In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.

\Verse And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.

\Verse Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.

\Verse And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.

\Verse So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.

\Verse And David went on, and grew great, and the \LORD God of hosts was with him.

\Verse And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.

\Verse And David perceived that the \LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.

\Verse And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.

\Verse And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, \Verse Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, \Verse And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.

\Verse But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.

\Verse The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

\Verse And David enquired of the \LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the \LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

\Verse And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The \LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.

\Verse And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.

\Verse And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

\Verse And when David enquired of the \LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.

\Verse And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the \LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.

\Verse And David did so, as the \LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.


\Chapter
\Verse Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.

\Verse And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the \LORD of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims.

\Verse And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.

\Verse And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark.

\Verse And David and all the house of Israel played before the \LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals.

\Verse And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.

\Verse And the anger of the \LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.

\Verse And David was displeased, because the \LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day.

\Verse And David was afraid of the \LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the \LORD come to me?  \Verse So David would not remove the ark of the \LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.

\Verse And the ark of the \LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the \LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household.

\Verse And it was told king David, saying, The \LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness.

\Verse And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the \LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

\Verse And David danced before the \LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.

\Verse So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the \LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

\Verse And as the ark of the \LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the \LORD; and she despised him in her heart.

\Verse And they brought in the ark of the \LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the \LORD.

\Verse And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the \LORD of hosts.

\Verse And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.

\Verse Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!  \Verse And David said unto Michal, It was before the \LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the \LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the \LORD.

\Verse And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.

\Verse Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.


\Chapter
\Verse And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the \LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies; \Verse That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.

\Verse And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the \LORD is with thee.

\Verse And it came to pass that night, that the word of the \LORD came unto Nathan, saying, \Verse Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the \LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?  \Verse Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.

\Verse In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?  \Verse Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the \LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: \Verse And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.

\Verse Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime, \Verse And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the \LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.

\Verse And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

\Verse He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.

\Verse I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: \Verse But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.

\Verse And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.

\Verse According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

\Verse Then went king David in, and sat before the \LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?  \Verse And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?  \Verse And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.

\Verse For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.

\Verse Wherefore thou art great, O \LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

\Verse And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?  \Verse For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, \LORD, art become their God.

\Verse And now, O \LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.

\Verse And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The \LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.

\Verse For thou, O \LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

\Verse And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: \Verse Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.


\Chapter
\Verse And after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.

\Verse And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.

\Verse David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

\Verse And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.

\Verse And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

\Verse Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the \LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

\Verse And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

\Verse And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.

\Verse When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, \Verse Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass: \Verse Which also king David did dedicate unto the \LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued; \Verse Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

\Verse And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.

\Verse And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And the \LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

\Verse And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.

\Verse And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; \Verse And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe; \Verse And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

\Verse And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?  \Verse And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba?  And he said, Thy servant is he.

\Verse And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet.

\Verse And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.

\Verse Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.

\Verse Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant!  \Verse And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.

\Verse And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?  \Verse Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.

\Verse Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

\Verse Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons.

\Verse And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.

\Verse So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.


\Chapter
\Verse And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

\Verse Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.

\Verse And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?  \Verse Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.

\Verse When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.

\Verse And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.

\Verse And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.

\Verse And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.

\Verse When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians: \Verse And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against the children of Ammon.

\Verse And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.

\Verse Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the \LORD do that which seemeth him good.

\Verse And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.

\Verse And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.

\Verse And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.

\Verse And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

\Verse And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.

\Verse And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.

\Verse And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.


\Chapter
\Verse And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.

\Verse And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.

\Verse And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?  \Verse And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.

\Verse And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I am with child.

\Verse And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.

\Verse And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.

\Verse And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet.  And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess of meat from the king.

\Verse But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.

\Verse And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy journey?  why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?  \Verse And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.

\Verse And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow.

\Verse And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house.

\Verse And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

\Verse And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.

\Verse And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were.

\Verse And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.

\Verse Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; \Verse And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king, \Verse And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?  \Verse Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

\Verse So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for.

\Verse And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate.

\Verse And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

\Verse Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.

\Verse And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.

\Verse And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the \LORD.


\Chapter
\Verse And the \LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.

\Verse The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: \Verse But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.

\Verse And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.

\Verse And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the \LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die: \Verse And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.

\Verse And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the \LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; \Verse And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.

\Verse Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the \LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.

\Verse Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.

\Verse Thus saith the \LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.

\Verse For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.

\Verse And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the \LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The \LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.

\Verse Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the \LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die.

\Verse And Nathan departed unto his house. And the \LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.

\Verse David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

\Verse And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.

\Verse And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?  \Verse But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.

\Verse Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the \LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.

\Verse Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.

\Verse And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?  \Verse But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast?  can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.

\Verse And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the \LORD loved him.

\Verse And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the \LORD.

\Verse And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.

\Verse And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

\Verse Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.

\Verse And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.

\Verse And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.

\Verse And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.


\Chapter
\Verse And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.

\Verse And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her.

\Verse But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

\Verse And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.

\Verse And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.

\Verse So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.

\Verse Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.

\Verse So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down.  And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.

\Verse And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him.

\Verse And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.

\Verse And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

\Verse And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.

\Verse And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.

\Verse Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.

\Verse Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

\Verse And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.

\Verse Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.

\Verse And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.

\Verse And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying.

\Verse And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.

\Verse But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.

\Verse And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.

\Verse And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons.

\Verse And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant.

\Verse And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.

\Verse Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?  \Verse But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.

\Verse Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.

\Verse And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded.

Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.

\Verse And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left.

\Verse Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

\Verse And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.

\Verse Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.

\Verse But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.

\Verse And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is.

\Verse And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.

\Verse But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.

\Verse So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.

\Verse And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.


\Chapter
\Verse Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart was toward Absalom.

\Verse And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead: \Verse And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.

\Verse And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.

\Verse And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.

\Verse And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.

\Verse And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.

\Verse And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee.

\Verse And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne be guiltless.

\Verse And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.

\Verse Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the \LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the \LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.

\Verse Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

\Verse And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished.

\Verse For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.

\Verse Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.

\Verse For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.

\Verse Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the \LORD thy God will be with thee.

\Verse Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.

\Verse And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?  And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid: \Verse To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.

\Verse And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.

\Verse And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.

\Verse So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.

\Verse And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face.

\Verse But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.

\Verse And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.

\Verse And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.

\Verse So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face.

\Verse Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.

\Verse Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire.

\Verse Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?  \Verse And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.

\Verse So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.


\Chapter
\Verse And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

\Verse And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.

\Verse And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.

\Verse Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!  \Verse And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.

\Verse And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.

\Verse And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the \LORD, in Hebron.

\Verse For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the \LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the \LORD.

\Verse And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.

\Verse But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

\Verse And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.

\Verse And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.

\Verse And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.

\Verse And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.

\Verse And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.

\Verse And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.

\Verse And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.

\Verse And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.

\Verse Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.

\Verse Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with thee.

\Verse And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the \LORD liveth, and as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be.

\Verse And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.

\Verse And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.

\Verse And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.

\Verse And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the \LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation: \Verse But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.

\Verse The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?  return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

\Verse See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.

\Verse Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.

\Verse And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.

\Verse And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O \LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.

\Verse And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: \Verse Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me: \Verse But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.

\Verse And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests?  therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

\Verse Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear.

\Verse So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.


\Chapter
\Verse And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.

\Verse And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.

\Verse And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.

\Verse Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

\Verse And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

\Verse And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.

\Verse And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial: \Verse The \LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the \LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.

\Verse Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.

\Verse And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah?  so let him curse, because the \LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?  \Verse And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the \LORD hath bidden him.

\Verse It may be that the \LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the \LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.

\Verse And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.

\Verse And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.

\Verse And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

\Verse And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king.

\Verse And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend?  why wentest thou not with thy friend?  \Verse And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the \LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.

\Verse And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.

\Verse Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.

\Verse And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.

\Verse So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.

\Verse And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.


\Chapter
\Verse Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night: \Verse And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only: \Verse And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.

\Verse And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.

\Verse Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.

\Verse And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying? if not; speak thou.

\Verse And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given is not good at this time.

\Verse For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.

\Verse Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.

\Verse And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men.

\Verse Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.

\Verse So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.

\Verse Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there.

\Verse And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the \LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the \LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.

\Verse Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.

\Verse Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.

\Verse Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David.

\Verse Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down.

\Verse And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.

\Verse And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.

\Verse And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.

\Verse Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan.

\Verse And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.

\Verse Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.

\Verse And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.

\Verse So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

\Verse And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, \Verse Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched pulse, \Verse And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.


\Chapter
\Verse And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.

\Verse And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.  And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.

\Verse But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.

\Verse And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.

\Verse And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.

\Verse So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim; \Verse Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.

\Verse For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

\Verse And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.

\Verse And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.

\Verse And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.

\Verse And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.

\Verse Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.

\Verse Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.

\Verse And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.

\Verse And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

\Verse And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.

\Verse Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.

\Verse Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the \LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.

\Verse And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.

\Verse Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.  And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

\Verse Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?  \Verse But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

\Verse And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.

\Verse And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near.

\Verse And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running alone.  And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.

\Verse And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

\Verse And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the \LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.

\Verse And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.

\Verse And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.

\Verse And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the \LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee.

\Verse And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.

\Verse And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!  
\Chapter
\Verse And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom.

\Verse And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.

\Verse And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

\Verse But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!  \Verse And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; \Verse In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.

\Verse Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the \LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.

\Verse Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent.

\Verse And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.

\Verse And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?  \Verse And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.

\Verse Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?  \Verse And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab.

\Verse And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.

\Verse So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.

\Verse And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

\Verse And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.

\Verse And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; \Verse And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perVersely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.

\Verse For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.

\Verse But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the \LORD's anointed?  \Verse And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?  \Verse Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.

\Verse And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.

\Verse And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?  \Verse And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.

\Verse And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes.

\Verse For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?  \Verse And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

\Verse And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.

\Verse And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

\Verse Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.

\Verse And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

\Verse And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?  \Verse I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?  \Verse Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?  \Verse Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.

\Verse And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.

\Verse And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place.

\Verse Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.

\Verse And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?  \Verse And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift?  \Verse And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?  And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.


\Chapter
\Verse And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.

\Verse So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.

\Verse And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.

\Verse Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.

\Verse So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.

\Verse And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.

\Verse And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

\Verse When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.

\Verse And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

\Verse But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.

\Verse And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.

\Verse And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.

\Verse When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

\Verse And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.

\Verse And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.

\Verse Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee.

\Verse And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab?  And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.

\Verse Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they ended the matter.

\Verse I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the \LORD?  \Verse And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.

\Verse The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.

\Verse Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab.  And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.

\Verse Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites: \Verse And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder: \Verse And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests: \Verse And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.


\Chapter
\Verse Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the \LORD. And the \LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.

\Verse And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)  \Verse Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you?  and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the \LORD?  \Verse And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.

\Verse And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel, \Verse Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the \LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the \LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give them.

\Verse But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the \LORD's oath that was between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.

\Verse But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite: \Verse And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the \LORD: and they fell all seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley harvest.

\Verse And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.

\Verse And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.

\Verse And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa: \Verse And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.

\Verse And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.

\Verse Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.

\Verse And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.

\Verse But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.

\Verse And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.

\Verse And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.

\Verse And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.

\Verse And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the brother of David slew him.

\Verse These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.


\Chapter
\Verse And David spake unto the \LORD the words of this song in the day that the \LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: \Verse And he said, The \LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; \Verse The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.

\Verse I will call on the \LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.

\Verse When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid; \Verse The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me; \Verse In my distress I called upon the \LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.

\Verse Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.

\Verse There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

\Verse He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.

\Verse And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.

\Verse And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.

\Verse Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.

\Verse The \LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.

\Verse And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.

\Verse And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the \LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.

\Verse He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters; \Verse He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.

\Verse They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the \LORD was my stay.

\Verse He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.

\Verse The \LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

\Verse For I have kept the ways of the \LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

\Verse For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.

\Verse I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.

\Verse Therefore the \LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.

\Verse With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.

\Verse With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.

\Verse And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.

\Verse For thou art my lamp, O \LORD: and the \LORD will lighten my darkness.

\Verse For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.

\Verse As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the \LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.

\Verse For who is God, save the \LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?  \Verse God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.

\Verse He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.

\Verse He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.

\Verse Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.

\Verse Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.

\Verse I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.

\Verse And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.

\Verse For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.

\Verse Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.

\Verse They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the \LORD, but he answered them not.

\Verse Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.

\Verse Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.

\Verse Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.

\Verse Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.

\Verse The \LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.

\Verse It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me.

\Verse And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.

\Verse Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O \LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.

\Verse He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.


\Chapter
\Verse Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said, \Verse The Spirit of the \LORD spake by me, and his word was in my tongue.

\Verse The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.

\Verse And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.

\Verse Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make it not to grow.

\Verse But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands: \Verse But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place.

\Verse These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.

\Verse And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away: \Verse He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the \LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.

\Verse And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.

\Verse But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the \LORD wrought a great victory.

\Verse And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.

\Verse And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.

\Verse And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!  \Verse And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the \LORD.

\Verse And he said, Be it far from me, O \LORD, that I should do this: is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives?  therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.

\Verse And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.

\Verse Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.

\Verse And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow: \Verse And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

\Verse These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.

\Verse He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the first three. And David set him over his guard.

\Verse Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, \Verse Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, \Verse Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, \Verse Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite, \Verse Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite, \Verse Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, \Verse Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash, \Verse Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, \Verse Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, \Verse Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite, \Verse Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite, \Verse Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite, \Verse Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, \Verse Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah, \Verse Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite, \Verse Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.


\Chapter
\Verse And again the anger of the \LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.

\Verse For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.

\Verse And Joab said unto the king, Now the \LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?  \Verse Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.

\Verse And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer: \Verse Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon, \Verse And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, even to Beersheba.

\Verse So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.

\Verse And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.

\Verse And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people.

And David said unto the \LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O \LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

\Verse For when David was up in the morning, the word of the \LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying, \Verse Go and say unto David, Thus saith the \LORD, I offer thee three things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

\Verse So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.

\Verse And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the \LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.

\Verse So the \LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.

\Verse And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the \LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the \LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite.

\Verse And David spake unto the \LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.

\Verse And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the \LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.

\Verse And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the \LORD commanded.

\Verse And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.

\Verse And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant?  And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the \LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.

\Verse And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.

\Verse All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The \LORD thy God accept thee.

\Verse And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the \LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.

\Verse And David built there an altar unto the \LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the \LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
