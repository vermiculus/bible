\chapter
\verse Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

\verse Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, \verse Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, \verse Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

\verse And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

\verse And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.

\verse And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.

\verse Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.

\verse And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we: \verse Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.

\verse Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.

\verse But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.

And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

\verse And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: \verse And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

\verse And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: \verse And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

\verse But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

\verse And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?  \verse And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.

\verse Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

\verse And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.

\verse And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

\chapter
\verse And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.

\verse And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

\verse And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.

\verse And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.

\verse And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.

\verse And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.

\verse Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?  \verse And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.

\verse And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.

\verse And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.

\verse And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.

\verse And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

\verse And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?  \verse And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.

\verse Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.

\verse Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

\verse And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.

\verse And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?  \verse And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.

\verse And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

\verse And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.

\verse And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

\verse And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

\verse And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

\verse And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.

\chapter
\verse Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

\verse And the angel of the \LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

\verse And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.

\verse And when the \LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.

\verse And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

\verse Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.

\verse And the \LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; \verse And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

\verse Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.

\verse Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

\verse And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?  \verse And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

\verse And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?  \verse And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.

\verse And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the \LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

\verse Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The \LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: \verse And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

\verse And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The \LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the \LORD our God.

\verse And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.

\verse And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.

\verse And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.

\verse But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

\chapter
\verse And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The \LORD hath not appeared unto thee.

\verse And the \LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.

\verse And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: \verse That they may believe that the \LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.

\verse And the \LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

\verse And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

\verse And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.

\verse And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

\verse And Moses said unto the \LORD, O my \LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

\verse And the \LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the \LORD?  \verse Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.

\verse And he said, O my \LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.

\verse And the anger of the \LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.  And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.

\verse And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.

\verse And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.

\verse And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.

\verse And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.

\verse And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.

\verse And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the \LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn: \verse And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.

\verse And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the \LORD met him, and sought to kill him.

\verse Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.

\verse So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.

\verse And the \LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.  And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.

\verse And Moses told Aaron all the words of the \LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.

\verse And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: \verse And Aaron spake all the words which the \LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

\verse And the people believed: and when they heard that the \LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

\chapter
\verse And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the \LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.

\verse And Pharaoh said, Who is the \LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the \LORD, neither will I let Israel go.

\verse And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the \LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.

\verse And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.

\verse And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.

\verse And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, \verse Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.

\verse And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

\verse Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.

\verse And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

\verse Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.

\verse So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

\verse And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.

\verse And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?  \verse Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?  \verse There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.

\verse But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the \LORD.

\verse Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

\verse And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.

\verse And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: \verse And they said unto them, The \LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.

\verse And Moses returned unto the \LORD, and said, \LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?  \verse For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.

\chapter
\verse Then the \LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

\verse And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the \LORD: \verse And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

\verse And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.

\verse And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

\verse Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the \LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: \verse And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the \LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

\verse And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the \LORD.

\verse And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \verse Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.

\verse And Moses spake before the \LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?  \verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

\verse These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.

\verse And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.

\verse And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

\verse The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.

\verse And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.

\verse And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.

\verse And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.

\verse And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

\verse And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

\verse And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

\verse And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.

\verse And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.

\verse These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the \LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.

\verse These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.

\verse And it came to pass on the day when the \LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, \verse That the \LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the \LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

\verse And Moses said before the \LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?  \chapter \verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

\verse Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.

\verse And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.

\verse But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

\verse And the Egyptians shall know that I am the \LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.

\verse And Moses and Aaron did as the \LORD commanded them, so did they.

\verse And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, \verse When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

\verse And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the \LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

\verse Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.

\verse For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

\verse And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the \LORD had said.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.

\verse Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.

\verse And thou shalt say unto him, The \LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.

\verse Thus saith the \LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the \LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

\verse And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.

\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.

\verse And Moses and Aaron did so, as the \LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.

\verse And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

\verse And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the \LORD had said.

\verse And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.

\verse And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

\verse And seven days were fulfilled, after that the \LORD had smitten the river.

\chapter
\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the \LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

\verse And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: \verse And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: \verse And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.

\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.

\verse And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

\verse And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

\verse Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the \LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the \LORD.

\verse And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?  \verse And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the \LORD our God.

\verse And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.

\verse And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the \LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.

\verse And the \LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

\verse And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.

\verse But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the \LORD had said.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

\verse And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

\verse And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.

\verse Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the \LORD had said.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the \LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

\verse Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.

\verse And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the \LORD in the midst of the earth.

\verse And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.

\verse And the \LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.

\verse And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.

\verse And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the \LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?  \verse We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the \LORD our God, as he shall command us.

\verse And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the \LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.

\verse And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the \LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the \LORD.

\verse And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the \LORD.

\verse And the \LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.

\verse And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.

\chapter
\verse Then the \LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the \LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

\verse For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, \verse Behold, the hand of the \LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.

\verse And the \LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel.

\verse And the \LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the \LORD shall do this thing in the land.

\verse And the \LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.

\verse And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

\verse And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

\verse And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.

\verse And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.

\verse And the \LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the \LORD had spoken unto Moses.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the \LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

\verse For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.

\verse For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.

\verse And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.

\verse As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?  \verse Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.

\verse Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

\verse He that feared the word of the \LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: \verse And he that regarded not the word of the \LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.

\verse And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the \LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the \LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

\verse So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

\verse And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.

\verse Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.

\verse And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the \LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.

\verse Intreat the \LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.

\verse And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the \LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the \LORD's.

\verse But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the \LORD God.

\verse And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.

\verse But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.

\verse And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the \LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.

\verse And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.

\verse And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the \LORD had spoken by Moses.

\chapter
\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him: \verse And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the \LORD.

\verse And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the \LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.

\verse Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast: \verse And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: \verse And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

\verse And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the \LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?  \verse And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the \LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?  \verse And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the \LORD.

\verse And he said unto them, Let the \LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.

\verse Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the \LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.

\verse And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the \LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.

\verse And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.

\verse For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.

\verse Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the \LORD your God, and against you.

\verse Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the \LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.

\verse And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the \LORD.

\verse And the \LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.

\verse But the \LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.

\verse And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: \verse They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

\verse And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the \LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.

\verse And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the \LORD our God.

\verse Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the \LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the \LORD, until we come thither.

\verse But the \LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.

\verse And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.

\verse And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.

\chapter
\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.

\verse Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of gold.

\verse And the \LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians.

Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

\verse And Moses said, Thus saith the \LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: \verse And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.

\verse And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

\verse But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the \LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.

\verse And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

\verse And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the \LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.

\chapter
\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying, \verse This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.

\verse Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house: \verse And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.

\verse Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats: \verse And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.

\verse And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.

\verse And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

\verse Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.

\verse And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.

\verse And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the \LORD's passover.

\verse For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the \LORD.

\verse And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.

\verse And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the \LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.

\verse Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

\verse And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.

\verse And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.

\verse In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.

\verse Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.

\verse Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.

\verse Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.

\verse And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.

\verse For the \LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the \LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.

\verse And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.

\verse And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the \LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.

\verse And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?  \verse That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the \LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.

\verse And the children of Israel went away, and did as the \LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

\verse And it came to pass, that at midnight the \LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

\verse And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.

\verse And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the \LORD, as ye have said.

\verse Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.

\verse And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.

\verse And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

\verse And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: \verse And the \LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.

\verse And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.

\verse And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.

\verse And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.

\verse Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

\verse And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the \LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

\verse It is a night to be much observed unto the \LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the \LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: \verse But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

\verse A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

\verse In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.

\verse All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

\verse And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the \LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.

\verse One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.

\verse Thus did all the children of Israel; as the \LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

\verse And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the \LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

\chapter
\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \verse Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.

\verse And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the \LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.

\verse This day came ye out in the month Abib.

\verse And it shall be when the \LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.

\verse Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the \LORD.

\verse Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.

\verse And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the \LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.

\verse And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the \LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the \LORD brought thee out of Egypt.

\verse Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.

\verse And it shall be when the \LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, \verse That thou shalt set apart unto the \LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the \LORD's.

\verse And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.

\verse And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the \LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: \verse And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the \LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the \LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.

\verse And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the \LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.

\verse And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: \verse But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

\verse And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

\verse And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.

\verse And the \LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: \verse He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

\chapter
\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \verse Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.

\verse For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

\verse And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the \LORD. And they did so.

\verse And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?  \verse And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: \verse And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

\verse And the \LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.

\verse But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.

\verse And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the \LORD.

\verse And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?  \verse Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.

\verse And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the \LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.

\verse The \LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?  speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: \verse But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.

\verse And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

\verse And the Egyptians shall know that I am the \LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

\verse And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: \verse And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.

\verse And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the \LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

\verse And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.

\verse And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

\verse And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the \LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, \verse And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the \LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

\verse And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the \LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

\verse And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.

\verse But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.

\verse Thus the \LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.

\verse And Israel saw that great work which the \LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the \LORD, and believed the \LORD, and his servant Moses.

\chapter
\verse Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the \LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the \LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

\verse The \LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.

\verse The \LORD is a man of war: the \LORD is his name.

\verse Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

\verse The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.

\verse Thy right hand, O \LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O \LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

\verse And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.

\verse And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.

\verse The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

\verse Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.

\verse Who is like unto thee, O \LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?  \verse Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

\verse Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.

\verse The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.

\verse Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.

\verse Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O \LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.

\verse Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O \LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O \LORD, which thy hands have established.

\verse The \LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

\verse For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the \LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.

\verse And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.

\verse And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the \LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

\verse So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.

\verse And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.

\verse And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?  \verse And he cried unto the \LORD; and the \LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, \verse And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the \LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the \LORD that healeth thee.

\verse And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.

\chapter
\verse And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.

\verse And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: \verse And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the \LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

\verse Then said the \LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.

\verse And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.

\verse And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the \LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: \verse And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the \LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the \LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?  \verse And Moses said, This shall be, when the \LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the \LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the \LORD.

\verse And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the \LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.

\verse And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the \LORD appeared in the cloud.

\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \verse I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the \LORD your God.

\verse And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.

\verse And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.

\verse And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the \LORD hath given you to eat.

\verse This is the thing which the \LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.

\verse And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.

\verse And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.

\verse And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

\verse Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.

\verse And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

\verse And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.

\verse And he said unto them, This is that which the \LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the \LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

\verse And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.

\verse And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the \LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

\verse Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

\verse And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?  \verse See, for that the \LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.

\verse So the people rested on the seventh day.

\verse And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.

\verse And Moses said, This is the thing which the \LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

\verse And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the \LORD, to be kept for your generations.

\verse As the \LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.

\verse And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.

\verse Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

\chapter
\verse And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the \LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.

\verse Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the \LORD?  \verse And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?  \verse And Moses cried unto the \LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.

\verse Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.

\verse And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the \LORD, saying, Is the \LORD among us, or not?  \verse Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

\verse And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.

\verse So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

\verse And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

\verse But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.

\verse And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

\verse And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi: \verse For he said, Because the \LORD hath sworn that the \LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

\chapter
\verse When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the \LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; \verse Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back, \verse And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: \verse And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: \verse And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: \verse And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

\verse And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.

\verse And Moses told his father in law all that the \LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the \LORD delivered them.

\verse And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the \LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

\verse And Jethro said, Blessed be the \LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

\verse Now I know that the \LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

\verse And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.

\verse And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.

\verse And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?  \verse And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God: \verse When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.

\verse And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.

\verse Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.

\verse Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: \verse And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.

\verse Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: \verse And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.

\verse If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.

\verse So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.

\verse And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

\verse And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

\verse And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.

\chapter
\verse In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.

\verse For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.

\verse And Moses went up unto God, and the \LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; \verse Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

\verse Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: \verse And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.

These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.

\verse And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the \LORD commanded him.

\verse And all the people answered together, and said, All that the \LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the \LORD.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever.

And Moses told the words of the people unto the \LORD.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, \verse And be ready against the third day: for the third day the \LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.

\verse And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: \verse There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.

\verse And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.

\verse And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.

\verse And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.

\verse And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

\verse And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the \LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

\verse And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.

\verse And the \LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the \LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the \LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.

\verse And let the priests also, which come near to the \LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the \LORD break forth upon them.

\verse And Moses said unto the \LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.

\verse And the \LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the \LORD, lest he break forth upon them.

\verse So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

\chapter
\verse And God spake all these words, saying, \verse I am the \LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

\verse Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

\verse Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

\verse Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the \LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me; \verse And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.

\verse Thou shalt not take the name of the \LORD thy God in vain; for the \LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

\verse Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

\verse Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: \verse But the seventh day is the sabbath of the \LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: \verse For in six days the \LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the \LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

\verse Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the \LORD thy God giveth thee.

\verse Thou shalt not kill.

\verse Thou shalt not commit adultery.

\verse Thou shalt not steal.

\verse Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

\verse Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

\verse And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

\verse And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

\verse And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.

\verse And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.

\verse Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.

\verse An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

\verse And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.

\verse Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.

\chapter
\verse Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

\verse If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

\verse If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.

\verse If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.

\verse And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: \verse Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.

\verse And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.

\verse If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.

\verse And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.

\verse If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.

\verse And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money.

\verse He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.

\verse And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

\verse But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.

\verse And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.

\verse And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

\verse And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death.

\verse And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed: \verse If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.

\verse And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

\verse Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.

\verse If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.

\verse And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, \verse Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, \verse Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

\verse And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.

\verse And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.

\verse If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.

\verse But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.

\verse If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

\verse Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.

\verse If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.

\verse And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; \verse The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.

\verse And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they shall divide.

\verse Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own.

\chapter
\verse If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.

\verse If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.

\verse If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.

\verse If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.

\verse If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.

\verse If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.

\verse If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.

\verse If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.

\verse For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.

\verse If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it: \verse Then shall an oath of the \LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.

\verse And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.

\verse If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.

\verse And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.

\verse But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.

\verse And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

\verse If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

\verse Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

\verse Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

\verse He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the \LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.

\verse Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

\verse Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

\verse If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry; \verse And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.

\verse If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.

\verse If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: \verse For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

\verse Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.

\verse Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.

\verse Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.

\verse And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.

\chapter
\verse Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

\verse Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment: \verse Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

\verse If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.

\verse If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.

\verse Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

\verse Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

\verse And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.

\verse Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

\verse And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits thereof: \verse But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.

\verse Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

\verse And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.

\verse Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

\verse Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:) \verse And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.

\verse Three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the \LORD God.

\verse Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

\verse The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the \LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

\verse Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

\verse Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

\verse But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.

\verse For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.

\verse Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.

\verse And ye shall serve the \LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.

\verse There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.

\verse I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.

\verse And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

\verse I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.

\verse By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

\verse And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.

\verse Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

\verse They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.

\chapter
\verse And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the \LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off.

\verse And Moses alone shall come near the \LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

\verse And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, \verse And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense, \verse And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot.

\verse And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

\verse And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

\verse And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.

\verse Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.

\verse Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight: \verse And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy: \verse And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

\verse And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee holy for the \LORD.

\verse Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut off from his people.

\chapter
\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \verse See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: \verse And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, \verse To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, \verse And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

\verse And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; \verse The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle, \verse And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, \verse And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot, \verse And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office, \verse And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \verse Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the \LORD that doth sanctify you.

\verse Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

\verse Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the \LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

\verse Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.

\verse It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the \LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

\verse And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.

\chapter
\verse And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

\verse And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.

\verse And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

\verse And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

\verse And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the \LORD.

\verse And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: \verse They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: \verse Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.

\verse And Moses besought the \LORD his God, and said, \LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?  \verse Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.

\verse Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.

\verse And the \LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.

\verse And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.

\verse And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.

\verse And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

\verse And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.

\verse And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.

\verse And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.

\verse And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?  \verse And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.

\verse For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

\verse And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.

\verse And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) \verse Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the \LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

\verse And he said unto them, Thus saith the \LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.

\verse And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.

\verse For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the \LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.

\verse And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the \LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.

\verse And Moses returned unto the \LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

\verse Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.

\verse Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.

\verse And the \LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.

\chapter
\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: \verse And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: \verse Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.

\verse And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.

\verse For the \LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.

\verse And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.

\verse And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the \LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.

\verse And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.

\verse And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.

\verse And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.

\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.

\verse And Moses said unto the \LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.

\verse Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.

\verse And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.

\verse And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.

\verse For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.

\verse And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

\verse And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the \LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.

\verse And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.

\verse And the \LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: \verse And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: \verse And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.

\chapter
\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.

\verse And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.

\verse And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.

\verse And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the \LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.

\verse And the \LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the \LORD.

\verse And the \LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The \LORD, The \LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, \verse Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.

\verse And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.

\verse And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O \LORD, let my \LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.

\verse And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the \LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.

\verse Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

\verse Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: \verse But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: \verse For thou shalt worship no other god: for the \LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God: \verse Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; \verse And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods.

\verse Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

\verse The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.

\verse All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

\verse But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.

\verse Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

\verse And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.

\verse Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the \LORD God, the God of Israel.

\verse For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the \LORD thy God thrice in the year.

\verse Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.

\verse The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the \LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.

\verse And the \LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.

\verse And he was there with the \LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

\verse And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.

\verse And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.

\verse And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.

\verse And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the \LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai.

\verse And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.

\verse But when Moses went in before the \LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

\verse And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

\chapter
\verse And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which the \LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.

\verse Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the \LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.

\verse Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.

\verse And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the \LORD commanded, saying, \verse Take ye from among you an offering unto the \LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the \LORD; gold, and silver, and brass, \verse And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, \verse And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood, \verse And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet incense, \verse And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the breastplate.

\verse And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the \LORD hath commanded; \verse The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets, \verse The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the vail of the covering, \verse The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread, \verse The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps, with the oil for the light, \verse And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle, \verse The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, \verse The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court, \verse The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords, \verse The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.

\verse And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.

\verse And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the \LORD's offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments.

\verse And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the \LORD.

\verse And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

\verse Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the \LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

\verse And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

\verse And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats' hair.

\verse And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; \verse And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.

\verse The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the \LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the \LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.

\verse And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the \LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; \verse And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; \verse And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, \verse And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

\verse And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

\verse Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.

\chapter
\verse Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the \LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the \LORD had commanded.

\verse And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the \LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: \verse And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.

\verse And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made; \verse And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the \LORD commanded to make.

\verse And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.

\verse For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.

\verse And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.

\verse The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size.

\verse And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.

\verse And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

\verse Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another.

\verse And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

\verse And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

\verse The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size.

\verse And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.

\verse And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second.

\verse And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.

\verse And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that.

\verse And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up.

\verse The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half.

\verse One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

\verse And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward: \verse And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

\verse And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the north corner, he made twenty boards, \verse And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.

\verse And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.

\verse And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.

\verse And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners.

\verse And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.

\verse And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle, \verse And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward.

\verse And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end to the other.

\verse And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

\verse And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

\verse And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.

\verse And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework; \verse And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were of brass.

\chapter
\verse And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it: \verse And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.

\verse And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the other side of it.

\verse And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold.

\verse And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.

\verse And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth thereof.

\verse And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; \verse One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof.

\verse And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the cherubims.

\verse And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof: \verse And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold round about.

\verse Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

\verse And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

\verse Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.

\verse And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.

\verse And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes, and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, of pure gold.

\verse And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, were of the same: \verse And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof: \verse Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.

\verse And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers: \verse And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.

\verse Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.

\verse And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, of pure gold.

\verse Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels thereof.

\verse And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns thereof were of the same.

\verse And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown of gold round about.

\verse And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.

\verse And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels thereof made he of brass.

\verse And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

\chapter
\verse And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

\verse And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.

\verse They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the two edges was it coupled together.

\verse And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel.

\verse And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

\verse It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.

\verse And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

\verse And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

\verse And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

\verse And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

\verse And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes.

\verse And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work of pure gold.

\verse And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

\verse And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the side of the ephod inward.

\verse And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod.

\verse And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

\verse And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should not rend.

\verse And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

\verse And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates; \verse A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, \verse And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen, \verse And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, of needlework; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE \LORD.

\verse And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high upon the mitre; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the \LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

\verse And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets, \verse And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering, \verse The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat, \verse The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread, \verse The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for light, \verse And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door, \verse The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot, \verse The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation, \verse The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to minister in the priest's office.

\verse According to all that the \LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work.

\verse And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the \LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.

\chapter
\verse And the \LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \verse On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

\verse And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail.

\verse And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

\verse And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.

\verse And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

\verse And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.

\verse And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate.

\verse And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.

\verse And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy.

\verse And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

\verse And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

\verse And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.

\verse And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: \verse And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.

\verse Thus did Moses: according to all that the \LORD commanded him, so did he.

\verse And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

\verse And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.

\verse And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: \verse And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

\verse And he set the bread in order upon it before the \LORD; as the \LORD had commanded Moses.

\verse And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.

\verse And he lighted the lamps before the \LORD; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail: \verse And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

\verse And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

\verse And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat: \verse When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the \LORD commanded Moses.

\verse And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.

\verse Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the \LORD filled the tabernacle.

\verse And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the \LORD filled the tabernacle.

\verse And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: \verse But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.

\verse For the cloud of the \LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
