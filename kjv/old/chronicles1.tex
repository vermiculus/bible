\Verse So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.

\Verse Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims.

\Verse And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh; \Verse Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah.

\Verse And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the \LORD, were keepers of the entry.

\Verse And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, and the \LORD was with him.

\Verse And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

\Verse All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office.

\Verse So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the \LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards.

\Verse In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.

\Verse And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them.

\Verse For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.

\Verse And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them.

\Verse And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale.

\Verse Some of them also were appointed to oVersee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

\Verse And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices.

\Chapter
\Verse Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.

\Verse And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.

\Verse And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.

\Verse Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

\Verse And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.

\Verse So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.

\Verse And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.

\Verse And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.

\Verse And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.

\Verse And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.

\Verse And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, \Verse They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

\Verse So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the \LORD, even against the word of the \LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to enquire of it; \Verse And enquired not of the \LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.


\Chapter
\Verse Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

\Verse And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the \LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.

\Verse Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the \LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the \LORD by Samuel.

\Verse And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.

\Verse And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.

\Verse And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.

\Verse And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.

\Verse And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

\Verse So David waxed greater and greater: for the \LORD of hosts was with him.

\Verse These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the \LORD concerning Israel.

\Verse And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.

\Verse And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.

\Verse He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.

\Verse And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the \LORD saved them by a great deliverance.

\Verse Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

\Verse And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison was then at Bethlehem.

\Verse And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!  \Verse And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the \LORD.

\Verse And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.  Therefore he would not drink it.

These things did these three mightiest.

\Verse And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.

\Verse Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.

\Verse Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.

\Verse And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

\Verse These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.

\Verse Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.

\Verse Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, \Verse Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, \Verse Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite, \Verse Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, \Verse Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, \Verse Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, \Verse Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, \Verse Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, \Verse The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite, \Verse Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, \Verse Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, \Verse Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, \Verse Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri, \Verse Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, \Verse Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, \Verse Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, \Verse Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him, \Verse Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, \Verse Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite, \Verse Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, \Verse Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite, \Verse Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.


\Chapter
\Verse Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.

\Verse They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.

\Verse The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.

\Verse And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite, \Verse Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite, \Verse Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites, \Verse And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

\Verse And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains; \Verse Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, \Verse Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, \Verse Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, \Verse Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, \Verse Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.

\Verse These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.

\Verse These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west.

\Verse And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David.

\Verse And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.

\Verse Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee.

Then David received them, and made them captains of the band.

\Verse And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.

\Verse As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.

\Verse And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.

\Verse For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.

\Verse And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the \LORD.

\Verse The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.

\Verse Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred.

\Verse Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.

\Verse And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred; \Verse And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's house twenty and two captains.

\Verse And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.

\Verse And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.

\Verse And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.

\Verse And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.

\Verse Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart.

\Verse And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand.

\Verse And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.

\Verse And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.

\Verse And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.

\Verse All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.

\Verse And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.

\Verse Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.


\Chapter
\Verse And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.

\Verse And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and that it be of the \LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us: \Verse And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.

\Verse And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

\Verse So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.

\Verse And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the \LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims, whose name is called on it.

\Verse And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.

\Verse And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

\Verse And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

\Verse And the anger of the \LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.

\Verse And David was displeased, because the \LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.

\Verse And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?  \Verse So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.

\Verse And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the \LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.


\Chapter
\Verse Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.

\Verse And David perceived that the \LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.

\Verse And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.

\Verse Now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, \Verse And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, \Verse And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, \Verse And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.

\Verse And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them.

\Verse And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

\Verse And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the \LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.

\Verse So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.

\Verse And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.

\Verse And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.

\Verse Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.

\Verse And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.

\Verse David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.

\Verse And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the \LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.


\Chapter
\Verse And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

\Verse Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the \LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.

\Verse And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the \LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.

\Verse And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: \Verse Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: \Verse Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: \Verse Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty: \Verse Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred: \Verse Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: \Verse Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.

\Verse And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, \Verse And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the \LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it.

\Verse For because ye did it not at the first, the \LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.

\Verse So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the \LORD God of Israel.

\Verse And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the \LORD.

\Verse And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.

\Verse So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; \Verse And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.

\Verse So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass; \Verse And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; \Verse And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.

\Verse And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.

\Verse And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.

\Verse And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

\Verse So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the \LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.

\Verse And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the \LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.

\Verse And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him an ephod of linen.

\Verse Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the \LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.

\Verse And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the \LORD came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.


\Chapter
\Verse So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.

\Verse And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the \LORD.

\Verse And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.

\Verse And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the \LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the \LORD God of Israel: \Verse Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; \Verse Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

\Verse Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the \LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

\Verse Give thanks unto the \LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.

\Verse Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.

\Verse Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the \LORD.

\Verse Seek the \LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

\Verse Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; \Verse O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.

\Verse He is the \LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.

\Verse Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; \Verse Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; \Verse And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, \Verse Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; \Verse When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

\Verse And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people; \Verse He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, \Verse Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

\Verse Sing unto the \LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.

\Verse Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.

\Verse For great is the \LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods.

\Verse For all the gods of the people are idols: but the \LORD made the heavens.

\Verse Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.

\Verse Give unto the \LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the \LORD glory and strength.

\Verse Give unto the \LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the \LORD in the beauty of holiness.

\Verse Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.

\Verse Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let men say among the nations, The \LORD reigneth.

\Verse Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.

\Verse Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the \LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.

\Verse O give thanks unto the \LORD; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.

\Verse And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.

\Verse Blessed be the \LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the \LORD.

\Verse So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the \LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required: \Verse And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters: \Verse And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the \LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon, \Verse To offer burnt offerings unto the \LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do according to all that is written in the law of the \LORD, which he commanded Israel; \Verse And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the \LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever; \Verse And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.

\Verse And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.


\Chapter
\Verse Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the \LORD remaineth under curtains.

\Verse Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God is with thee.

\Verse And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, \Verse Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the \LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in: \Verse For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.

\Verse Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?  \Verse Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the \LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: \Verse And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.

\Verse Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning, \Verse And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.  Furthermore I tell thee that the \LORD will build thee an house.

\Verse And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.

\Verse He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.

\Verse I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee: \Verse But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.

\Verse According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

\Verse And David the king came and sat before the \LORD, and said, Who am I, O \LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?  \Verse And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O \LORD God.

\Verse What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant?  for thou knowest thy servant.

\Verse O \LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things.

\Verse O \LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.

\Verse And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?  \Verse For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, \LORD, becamest their God.

\Verse Therefore now, \LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.

\Verse Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The \LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.

\Verse For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.

\Verse And now, \LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: \Verse Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O \LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.


\Chapter
\Verse Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.

\Verse And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.

\Verse And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

\Verse And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.

\Verse And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

\Verse Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the \LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

\Verse And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

\Verse Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

\Verse Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; \Verse He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.

\Verse Them also king David dedicated unto the \LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

\Verse Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.

\Verse And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the \LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

\Verse So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.

\Verse And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.

\Verse And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; \Verse And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.


\Chapter
\Verse Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.

\Verse And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.

\Verse But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee?  are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?  \Verse Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.

\Verse Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served.  And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.

\Verse And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.

\Verse So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.

\Verse And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.

\Verse And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.

\Verse Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.

\Verse And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.

\Verse And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.

\Verse Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the \LORD do that which is good in his sight.

\Verse So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.

\Verse And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

\Verse And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

\Verse And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.

\Verse But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

\Verse And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.


\Chapter
\Verse And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.

\Verse And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.

\Verse And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

\Verse And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.

\Verse And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.

\Verse And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant.

\Verse But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him.

\Verse These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.


\Chapter
\Verse And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.

\Verse And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.

\Verse And Joab answered, The \LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants?  why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?  \Verse Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.

\Verse And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.

\Verse But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.

\Verse And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.

\Verse And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

\Verse And the \LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying, \Verse Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the \LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

\Verse So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the \LORD, Choose thee \Verse Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the \LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the \LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.

\Verse And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the \LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.

\Verse So the \LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.

\Verse And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the \LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand.  And the angel of the \LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

\Verse And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the \LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.

\Verse And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O \LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.

\Verse Then the angel of the \LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the \LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

\Verse And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the \LORD.

\Verse And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.

\Verse And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.

\Verse Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the \LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.

\Verse And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.

\Verse And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the \LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.

\Verse So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.

\Verse And David built there an altar unto the \LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the \LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.

\Verse And the \LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.

\Verse At that time when David saw that the \LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.

\Verse For the tabernacle of the \LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon.

\Verse But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the \LORD.


\Chapter
\Verse Then David said, This is the house of the \LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.

\Verse And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.

\Verse And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; \Verse Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.

\Verse And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the \LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.

\Verse Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the \LORD God of Israel.

\Verse And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the \LORD my God: \Verse But the word of the \LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.

\Verse Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.

\Verse He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.

\Verse Now, my son, the \LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the \LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.

\Verse Only the \LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the \LORD thy God.

\Verse Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the \LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.

\Verse Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the \LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.

\Verse Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.

\Verse Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the \LORD be with thee.

\Verse David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, \Verse Is not the \LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the \LORD, and before his people.

\Verse Now set your heart and your soul to seek the \LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the \LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the \LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the \LORD.


\Chapter
\Verse So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.

\Verse And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.

\Verse Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.

\Verse Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the \LORD; and six thousand were officers and judges: \Verse Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised the \LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to praise therewith.

\Verse And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

\Verse Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.

\Verse The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.

\Verse The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.  These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.

\Verse And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah.

These four were the sons of Shimei.

\Verse And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to their father's house.

\Verse The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

\Verse The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the \LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.

\Verse Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.

\Verse The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.

\Verse Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.

\Verse And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

\Verse Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.

\Verse Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

\Verse Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.

\Verse The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish.

\Verse And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them.

\Verse The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.

\Verse These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the \LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward.

\Verse For David said, The \LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever: \Verse And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.

\Verse For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above: \Verse Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the \LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; \Verse Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; \Verse And to stand every morning to thank and praise the \LORD, and likewise at even: \Verse And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the \LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the \LORD: \Verse And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the \LORD.


\Chapter
\Verse Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

\Verse But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office.

\Verse And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.

\Verse And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers.

\Verse Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

\Verse And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

\Verse Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, \Verse The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, \Verse The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, \Verse The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, \Verse The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah, \Verse The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, \Verse The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, \Verse The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, \Verse The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses, \Verse The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel, \Verse The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul, \Verse The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.

\Verse These were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the \LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the \LORD God of Israel had commanded him.

\Verse And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.

\Verse Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was Isshiah.

\Verse Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.

\Verse And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.

\Verse Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.

\Verse The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah.

\Verse The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.

\Verse The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.

\Verse Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.

\Verse Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.

\Verse The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.

\Verse These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren.


\Chapter
\Verse Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was: \Verse Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of the king.

\Verse Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the \LORD.

And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.

\Verse All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the \LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.

\Verse So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the \LORD, even all that were cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.

\Verse And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar.

\Verse Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve: \Verse The third to Zaccur, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The fourth to Izri, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The fifth to Nethaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The sixth to Bukkiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The seventh to Jesharelah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The eighth to Jeshaiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The ninth to Mattaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The tenth to Shimei, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The eleventh to Azareel, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The twelfth to Hashabiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The thirteenth to Shubael, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The fourteenth to Mattithiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The fifteenth to Jeremoth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The sixteenth to Hananiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The seventeenth to Joshbekashah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The eighteenth to Hanani, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The nineteenth to Mallothi, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The twentieth to Eliathah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The one and twentieth to Hothir, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The two and twentieth to Giddalti, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The three and twentieth to Mahazioth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve: \Verse The four and twentieth to Romamtiezer, he, his sons, and his brethren, were twelve.

\Verse Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in the house of the \LORD.

\Verse And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the house of their fathers, for every gate.

\Verse And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward.

\Verse To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.

\Verse To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward.

\Verse Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward four a day, and toward Asuppim two and two.

\Verse At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.

\Verse The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were over the treasures of the house of the \LORD.

\Verse Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites: \Verse And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of the treasures.

\Verse And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith his son.

\Verse Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had dedicated.

\Verse Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the \LORD.

\Verse And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.


\Chapter
\Verse Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand.

These were the princes of the tribes of Israel.

\Verse But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the \LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens.

\Verse Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.

\Verse And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah: \Verse And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub: \Verse And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite: \Verse And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash: \Verse And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai: \Verse Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: \Verse And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite.

\Chapter
\Verse And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.

\Verse Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the \LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building: \Verse But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.

\Verse Howbeit the \LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel: \Verse And of all my sons, (for the \LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the \LORD over Israel.

\Verse And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.

\Verse Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.

\Verse Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the \LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the \LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.

\Verse And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the \LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.

\Verse Take heed now; for the \LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

\Verse Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat, \Verse And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the \LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things: \Verse Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the \LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the \LORD.

\Verse He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service: \Verse Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.

\Verse And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver: \Verse Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver: \Verse And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the \LORD.

\Verse All this, said David, the \LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.

\Verse And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the \LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the \LORD.

\Verse And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.


\Chapter
\Verse Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the \LORD God.

\Verse Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.

\Verse Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.

\Verse Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal: \Verse The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the \LORD?  \Verse Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly, \Verse And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.

\Verse And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the \LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.

\Verse Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the \LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

\Verse Wherefore David blessed the \LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, \LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.

\Verse Thine, O \LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O \LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.

\Verse Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.

\Verse Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.

\Verse But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.

\Verse For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.

\Verse O \LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.

\Verse I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.

\Verse O \LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee: \Verse And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.

\Verse And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the \LORD your God.

And all the congregation blessed the \LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the \LORD, and the king.

\Verse And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the \LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the \LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: \Verse And did eat and drink before the \LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the \LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.

\Verse Then Solomon sat on the throne of the \LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

\Verse And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.

\Verse And the \LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.

\Verse Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.

\Verse And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.

\Verse And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

\Verse Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, \Verse With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
